MusicApi => It is not a problet to deploy it to azure or an amazon. but for that wee need to spent some money for domain, ssl certificate and db. 
However, via push history you can see that I have used PostgreSQL IIS, Azure and Even AWS services. Since it was not free(AWS, Azure), I had to delete and use PostgreSQL and IIS (but I used Azure Containers to save files and get their links)to save money and to show my knowledge and experience.
